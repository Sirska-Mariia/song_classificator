There are 4 notebooks:

1) EDA.ipynb
2) text_processing.ipynb
3) audio_processing.ipynb
4) modeling.ipynb


We trained 4 ML algorithms (Logistic regression, SVN, Random forest and KNN) for text-only, audio-only and text+audio baselines.

The results are in modeling.ipynb. Logistic regression for text+audio model has the best results.
