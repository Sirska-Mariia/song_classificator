There are 5 notebooks:

1) EDA.ipynb
2) text_processing.ipynb
3) audio_processing.ipynb
4) modeling.ipynb
We trained 4 ML algorithms (Logistic regression, SVN, Random forest and KNN) for text-only, audio-only and text+audio baselines. Logistic regression for text+audio model has the best results.
5) dl_modeling.ipynb
We trained deep learning models (tried text-only, audio-only models and combined model with a BERT encoder (for text) and an MLP (for audio)).
